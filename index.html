<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>The Knowledge Fortress is an organization aimed at preserving scientific knowledge and storing it resiliently for the benefit of future generations. Throughout history, many civilizations  were rich in knowledge, but the collapse of these civilizations led to the loss of this valuable knowledge. Our motivation stems from the realization that our civilization and the pillars of knowledge that carry it are vulnerable to collapse and loss and that numerous threats exist against the integrity of our collective wisdom. </p>

<section id="mission">
<h2>Mission statement</h2>
<p> Our mission is to resiliently store scientific knowledge, ensuring our discoveries are accessible throughout the generations. </p>

<section id="risks">
<h2>Risks to Digital Knowledge</h2>
<p>A lot of scientific accomplishments are stored in digital servers. The problem with digital servers is that they have not been meant to store data for centuries. Without active maintenance, data corruption will inevitably destroy much knowledge over time. Risks due to solar flares, wars, neglect, and natural disasters put digital storage under significant threat over the centuries. Furthermore, an artificial superintelligence might go rogue and hack and manipulate published scientific work, casting misinformation and marking the entirety of the collected empirical evidence as dubious. Hence, storing a read-only backup of published science is paramount.</p>
</section>

<section id="project-details">
<h2>Project details</h2>
<p>The Knowledge Fortress project aims to collect scientific papers, academic textbooks, and language guides to be collected. We aim to collect the knowledge and preserve it in the Arctic World Archive, a future-proof vault designed to withstand challenges to data integrity. This step is crucial in ensuring the safety and accessibility of our stored knowledge. </p>
